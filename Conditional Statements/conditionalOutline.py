#1) Make a int variable named a. Now make an if statement, and if a is more than
#5, print out "a is more than 5."
a = 7
if( a > 5 ):
    print ("a is more than 5")

#2) Make a boolean variable named b. Now make an if statement, and if b is True
#print out "b is True."
b = 9
if( b <= 10 ):
    print ("b is True")
    
#3) Make an int variable named c. Now make an if/elif statement, and if c is 
#more than 0, print "c is positive". Else if c is less than 0, print "c is
#negative".
c = 3
if( c > 0 ):
    print ( "c is positive") 
else:
    print ("c is negative")    


#4) Make an int variable named d. Now make an if/elif/else statement, and if 
#d is more than 0, print "d is positive". Else if d is less than 0, print "c is
#negative". Else, print "d is zero".
d = 4
if ( d > 0):
    print ("d is positive")
elif ( d < 0 ):
    print (" d is negative")
else:
    print (" d is zero")

#5) Make an if statement with any comparison, with a common SYNTAX error.
e = 1
if (e > 2 )
    print ("e is positive")
