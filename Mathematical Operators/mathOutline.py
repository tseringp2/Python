#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = "hello"
varTwo = "there"
y = var + varTwo

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = 1
varTwo = 2
y = var + varTwo 


#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = 5
varTwo = 1
y = var - varTwo


#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = 3.5
varTwo = 2.2
y = var - varTwo

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = 2
varTwo = 3
y = var * varTwo


#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
var = "good"
varTwo = 2
y= var * varTwo


#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = 8
varTwo = 4
y = var / varTwo

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = 4.5
varTwo = 2.5
y = var / varTwo


#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = 6
varTwo = 2
y = var % varTwo


#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = 4
varTwo = 2
y = var // varTwo


#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = 5
varTwo = 2
y = var ** varTwo


#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
var = 4
varTwo = 3
y = var + narTwo
