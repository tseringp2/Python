The goal of this function is to calculate the 
area of a circle.

The function gets a radius from the user and 
then calculates the area.

The function should print and
return the area.
'''
def circleArea():
    radius = input("What is the radius of your circle?")
    
    pi = 3.14
    squared = int(radius) * int(radius)
    area = pi * squared 
    print("The area is: " + area)
    return area
