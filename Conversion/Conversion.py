#Use input() to get the number of miles from the user. And store
#that int in a variable called miles.

#Convert miles to yards, using the following:
# 1 mile = 1760 yards.
miles = 1
yards = 1760
sentence = (str(miles) + " miles converts to " + str(yards) + " yards. ")
#Store the value in a variable called yards and print it out with a 
#simple statement.
yards = sentence
print(yards)
#Convert miles to feet, using the following:
# 1 mile = 5280 feet.
miles = 1
feet = 5280
sentence = (str(miles) + " miles converts to " + str(feet) + " feet. ")
#Store the value in a variable called feet and print it out with a 
#simple statement.
feet = sentence
print(feet)
#Convert miles to inches, using the following:
# 1 mile = 63,360 inches.
miles = 1
inches = 63360
sentence = (str(miles) + " miles converts to " + str(inches) + " inches. ")
#Store the value in a variable called inches and print it out with a
