#1) Check if "dog" is equal to "cat" and store the answer in variable b
b = ("dog"=="cat")
#2) Check if 1.24 is equal to 1.25 and store the answer in variable c
c = (1.24 == 1.25)
#3) Check if True is equal to False and store the answer in variable d
d = (True == False)
#4) Check if [1,2,3] is equal to [1,2,3] and store the answer in variable e
e = ([1,2,3] == [1,2,3])
#5) Check if 1 is less than or equal to 2 and store the answer in variable f
f = (1 <= 2)
#6) Check if 1 is greater than or equal to 2 and store the answer in variable g
g = (1 >= 2)
#7) Check if 1.66 is greater than or equal to 1.67 and store the answer in variable h
h = (1.66 >= 1.67)
#8) Check if 1.66 is less than or equal to 1.67 and store the answer in variable i
i = (1.66 <= 1.67)
#9) Check if 1 is less than 2 and store the answer in variable j
j = (1 < 2)
#10) Check if 1 is greater than 2 and store the answer in variable k
k = (1 > 2)
#11) Check if 11 divided by three 3 is less than 100 divided by 33 and store the answer
#  ) in variable l
y = (11 / 3) 
x = (100 / 33)
l = (y < x)
#12) Check if 9 times 7 is greater than 8 times 8 and store the answer in variable m
y = ( 9 * 7)
x = (8 * 8)
m = (y > x)
#13) Check if the square root of 3 is less than 1.15 squared and store the answer in
#  ) variable n
y = (3 ** .5)
x = (1.15 ** 2)
n = (y < x)
#14) Multiple 8 by 3 and store that in variable o, then divide 56 by 2 and store that
#  ) in variable p, finally check if o is greater then p and store the answer in variable q.
o = (8 * 3)
p = (56 / 2)
q = (o > p)
#15) Take the square root of 96 and store that in variable r, then square 8.6 and store
#  ) that in variable s, finally check if r is greater than or equal to s and store the
#  ) answer in t
r = (96 ** .5)
s = (8.6 ** 2)
t = (r >= s)
