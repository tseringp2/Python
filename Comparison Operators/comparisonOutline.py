This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = "apple"
x = "cats"
w = y == x 
print(w)


#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = 5
x = 3
w = y == x
print(w)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c = 5
f = 7
y = c > f
print(y)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
t = 9
p = 4
x = t < p 
print(x)


#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
e = 6
r = 8
o = e >= r 
print(o)


#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = 5
s = 4
f = y <= s 
print(f)


#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
l = 1
m = 3
y = l ==
