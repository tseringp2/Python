#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer

a = 7
a = 8

#Float

a = 2.5
a = 4.3

#String

a = "string"
name = "tsering"

#Boolean

a = True
a = False

#list

a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

a = ["stringOne", "stringTwo"]

a= [True, False, True]

a= [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]



#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
varA = 1
vara = 2


#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

varB = 2

varB = 3

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

var = 6

varc = var

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

list = [3, 4, 5]

listVar =  list[1]



#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first item
#in that list:

string = "tsering"

stringVar = string[0]
#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(listVar)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
